# Zuora Subscription Viewer Chrome Extension

This extension creates a visualisation of a Zuora subscription to aid understanding of what's going on for a GNM customer.

It does contain some Guardian business logic, such as Membership subscriptions being non-refundable, and displays holiday suspensions and rate-plan-ordering for Home Delivery subscriptions. If its use takes off internally the team may genericise it for public use.

The packaged extension can be downloaded by Guardian staff [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zuora-subscription-viewer/aamflkhcmbbhehdiecbnodkiaeboekkc).
